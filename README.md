# The 2-day Web Workshop

Have you wanted to learn how to build web sites or web applications and just didn't know where to start?  In this 2-day workshop, we'll cover the very basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get you started.  Then, we will take those skills and start building with ASP.NET Core, a free framework that allows you to build applications with HTML and C#.  On day 2, we will take our skills even further when we learn about Blazor, another free framework that allows you to build interactive applications with HTML, C#, and standard we technologies.
