## Project files and folders explained

The following table lists the files and folders associated in the project.

| Name                     | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *wwwroot/*               | Contains all the static files. For example CSS, images, and so on.                                  |
| *Pages/*                 | Contains Razor Pages and supporting files. Each Razor page is a pair of files:<br/>- A *.cshtml* file that contains markup with C# code using Razor syntax.<br/>- A *.cshtml.cs* `PageModel` class file that defines page handler methods and data used to render the page.                                                                                        |
| *RazorPagesMovie.csproj* | Contains configuration metadata for the project, such as dependencies.                              |
| *Program.cs*             | Serves as the app's managed entry point and configures app behavior, such as routing between pages. |
